**The ultimate web-based karaoke system for event organizers**

</div>

Titanium Kitten Karaoke is a professional karaoke management system specifically designed for organizers of karaoke events in bars, clubs, or parties. It handles complete song and playlist management and provides an intuitive user interface for both organizers and participants.

## 🎯 What is Titanium Kitten Karaoke?

Titanium Kitten Karaoke is a complete karaoke system accessible through a web browser. It works best on a web server with a static IP or custom domain, but can also be operated from home using Cloudflare Tunnel. Both administration and live videos are accessible through any modern web browser.

**💡 Tip:** Use a web server with a custom domain or a powerful desktop PC with Cloudflare Tunnel as server. During the live karaoke show, you then access it with a laptop through the browser.

### Install FFmpeg
- **Windows**: Download FFmpeg from the official website, extract it, and add the `bin` folder to your `PATH` environment variable ([FFmpeg Downloads](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)).
- **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` (or use your distribution's package manager)

#### Windows: Add FFmpeg to PATH (step-by-step)
1. Download the latest FFmpeg release and extract the archive (e.g., to `C:\ffmpeg`).
2. Locate the `bin` folder, e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`.
3. Press `Win` and search for "Environment Variables", open "Edit the system environment variables".
4. Click "Environment Variables...".
5. Under "System variables", select `Path` and click "Edit".
6. Click "New" and paste the path to your `bin` folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`).
7. Confirm all dialogs with "OK" and restart your terminal or IDE.

To verify installation, run in a new terminal:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```
You should see version information instead of a "not recognized" error.
